# Short Notes on Primary Memory

1. **Primary Memory**:
   - **Directly accessed by the processor** and is the **fastest available** memory.
   - **Volatile**: Data is lost once the power is switched off.
   - **Costly** compared to secondary memory, so it is optimized and available in small quantities.

2. **Types of Primary Memory**:
   - **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Fastest and most expensive type of memory. It is volatile and can be accessed directly by the processor.
     - **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**: Requires frequent refreshing to retain data, commonly used in PCs due to its higher storage capacity.
     - **SRAM (Static RAM)**: Faster than DRAM and doesn't require refreshing, but is more expensive and used in specialized applications.
   
   - **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**: Non-volatile memory, used for storing permanent data like the booting sequence. Data can only be read.
     - **PROM (Programmable ROM)**: Can be programmed once using a special hardware device.
     - **EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM)**: Can be erased and reprogrammed using UV rays or electrical signals (EEPROM).

3. **Cache Memory**:
   - A small, high-speed memory used to store frequently accessed data for faster processing.
   - Usually made of **SRAM**, and the process of storing data in cache for quick access is called **caching**.
   - **Cache Hit** occurs when the required data is found in the cache, saving access time. 

This outlines the key features and types of primary memory in a computer.
