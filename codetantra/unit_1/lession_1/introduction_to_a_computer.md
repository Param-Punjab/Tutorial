# 1.1.1 Introduction to a computer

- **Computer Definition**: An electronic device that receives input, processes it, and provides output as instructed.
- **Importance**: Computers are essential in modern life.
- **Accuracy**: They perform simple or complex tasks without errors.
- **Input-Process-Output Model**: Follows the workflow: Input → Process → Output.

# 1.1.2 Different Components of a Computer System

1. **Input Unit**: Devices used to input data into the computer. Examples include:
   - **Keyboard**: Input device with 104 keys for typing.
   - **Mouse**: A pointing device for selecting and interacting with on-screen elements.
   - **Scanner**: Converts physical documents into digital form.
   - **Joystick**: Used in games, controlling movement by pivoting on a base.

2. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and controlling operations. It includes:
   - **Memory Unit**: Stores instructions, data, and results. Includes:
     - **Primary Memory**: RAM (temporary) and ROM (permanent).
     - **Cache Memory**: Small, fast memory near the CPU.
     - **Secondary Memory**: External storage like hard disks, USBs, CDs.
   - **Control Unit**: Manages the operation of all components.
   - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.) and logic operations (comparing, selecting).

3. **Output Unit**: Devices that output processed data to the user. Examples include:
   - **Monitor**: Displays visual output.
   - **Printer**: Produces physical copies (e.g., Dot Matrix, Inkjet, Laser).
   - **Speakers**: Convert electronic signals into sound.
   - **Plotter**: Prints large-scale graphics like engineering drawings.

This covers the essential components of a computer system and their roles.

# 1.1.3 Characteristics of a Computer

1. **Speed**: Computers can perform operations at an extremely fast rate.
2. **Accuracy**: They provide highly accurate results with minimal chances of error, typically caused by human mistakes.
3. **Reliability**: Computers can repeatedly perform tasks without errors.
4. **Versatility**: They can handle a wide range of tasks, from simple data storage to complex calculations.
5. **Storage Capacity**: Computers can store vast amounts of data, far exceeding traditional methods like paper.

# 1.1.4 Computer Booting

1. **Booting**: The process of starting a computer, involving:
   - Powering on the system.
   - Loading the operating system into the computer's memory.
   - Preparing applications for use.

2. **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)**: The first program that runs when the computer starts. It is permanently programmed into the hardware (firmware).

3. **Types of Booting**:
   - **Cold Booting**: Starting the computer from an off state by switching on the power.
   - **Warm Booting**: Restarting the system when it’s already running, without reloading the BIOS, making it faster.

4. **Rebooting**: Restarting the system while it is already running.

# 1.1.5 Anatomy of a Computer

1. **Power Supply**: Converts 240V AC mains power into low voltage DC (+3.3V, +5V, +12V, -5V) required by the computer components.

2. **Monitor**: Displays visual output from the computer. The resolution, measured in pixels (e.g., 1024 x 768), determines the clarity of the display.

3. **Motherboard**: The main circuit board that connects key components like the CPU and RAM. It also contains expansion slots for add-on cards (e.g., VGA and NIC).

4. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The brain of the computer, executing programs and processing data.

5. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Short-term memory used by the computer to store data temporarily while running programs. Data in RAM is lost when the computer powers off.

6. **Storage Device**: Stores data long-term, usually a hard drive or SSD.

7. **Input Devices**:
   - **Mouse**: Controls the pointer in a graphical interface.
   - **Webcam**: Captures video and images.
   - **Joystick**: Used for navigating objects in games.
   - **Keyboard**: Main device for typing input.
   - **Microphone**: Inputs audio.
   - **Scanner**: Converts physical documents into digital form.

8. **Output Devices**:
   - **Monitor**: Displays visual data (CRT or LCD types).
   - **Speakers**: Produce audio output.
   - **Printer**: Generates hard copies of digital data.

This covers the essential components and devices that make up a typical desktop computer system.
