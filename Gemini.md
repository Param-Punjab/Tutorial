## A Note on Commands

**Disclaimer:** While I can provide a general overview of common Git commands, the specific commands and their usage can vary based on the Git client or platform you're using. It's always recommended to refer to the official Git documentation or your Git client's specific instructions for accurate and up-to-date information.

**Committing:**

* `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Creates a new commit with the specified message.

**Pushing:**

* `git push <remote> <branch>`: Pushes your local changes to a remote repository.

**Pulling:**

* `git pull <remote> <branch>`: Updates your local repository with changes from a remote repository.

**Branching:**

* `git branch <branch name>`: Creates a new branch.
* `git checkout <branch name>`: Switches to a different branch.
* `git merge <branch name>`: Merges changes from one branch into another.

**Viewing Changes:**

### Example Workflow

Here's a basic example of how you might use these commands:

1. **Create a new repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. **Create a new file and make changes:**
   ```bash
   touch new_file.txt
   echo "Hello, world!" > new_file.txt
   ```
3. **Stage the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add new_file.txt
   ```
4. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added new file"
   ```
5. **Create a new branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch feature_branch
   ```
6. **Switch to the new branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature_branch
   ```
7. **Make more changes and commit them:**
   ```bash
   # Make changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added more features"
   ```
8. **Merge the feature branch back into the master branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge feature_branch
   ```
9. **Push the changes to a remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

**Remember:** The specific commands and their usage can vary depending on your Git configuration and the platform you're using. Always refer to the documentation for accurate information.
