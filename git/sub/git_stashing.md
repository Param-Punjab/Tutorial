# What is a Git Stashing?
**Git stashing** allows you to temporarily save changes in your working directory that you arenâ€™t ready to commit. It stores your uncommitted modifications (tracked files, staged files, and optionally untracked files) so you can switch branches or work on something else without losing your progress.

### Common Git Stash Commands:

1. **Stash changes**:
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```
   Saves your uncommitted changes and returns your working directory to a clean state.

2. **View stash list**:
   ```bash
   git stash list
   ```
   Shows a list of all stashes.

3. **Apply the latest stash**:
   ```bash
   git stash apply
   ```
   Applies the most recent stash without removing it from the stash list.

4. **Apply and drop stash**:
   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```
   Applies the latest stash and removes it from the stash list.

5. **Stash untracked files**:
   ```bash
   git stash -u
   ```
   Stashes both tracked and untracked files.

Git stashing is helpful when you need to quickly switch contexts without losing your current work.
