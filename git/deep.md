# Session Notes: Introduction to Git and GitHub by Deep AI

### Overview
- Introduction to the session and audience engagement.
- Focus on Git as a version control system for managing code.

---

### Goal of the Session
- To understand the basics of Git and GitHub, including how to utilize version control and collaborate effectively in team projects.

---

### Key Concepts
1. **Git Basics:**
   - **Git:** A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

2. **Common Terminology:**
   - **Repository (Repo):** A storage space for your project on Git, containing files and their version history.
   - **Branch:** A parallel version of the repository allowing you to develop features separately from the main code.
   - **Fork:** Creating a personal copy of someone else's repository to modify.
   - **Commit:** Saving changes in the repository along with a message describing what was changed.
   - **Remote Repository:** A version of your project hosted on the internet (e.g., GitHub).

### Git Commands (with Functions)

#### 1. **Installation and Configuration**
   - **Install Git:**
     - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and follow the installation instructions.
   - **Set Username and Email:**
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
     ```
   - **Verify Configuration:**
     ```bash
     git config --list
     ```

#### 2. **Creating a Repository**
   - **Initialize a New Repository:**
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - **Clone an Existing Repository:**
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

#### 3. **Tracking Changes**
   - **Check Repository Status:**
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
   - **Add Changes to Staging Area:**
     - To add specific files:
     ```bash
     git add [filename]
     ```
     - To add all changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - **Commit Changes:**
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     ```

#### 4. **Viewing Commit History**
   - **View Commit Log:**
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

#### 5. **Managing Branches**
   - **Create a New Branch:**
     ```bash
     git branch [branch-name]
     ```
   - **Switch to a Branch:**
     ```bash
     git checkout [branch-name]
     ```
   - **Create and Switch in One Command:**
     ```bash
     git checkout -b [branch-name]
     ```
   - **Delete a Branch:**
     ```bash
     git branch -d [branch-name]
     ```

#### 6. **Merging Branches**
   - **Merge Another Branch into Current Branch:**
     ```bash
     git merge [branch-name]
     ```

#### 7. **Working with Remote Repositories**
   - **Add a Remote Repository:**
     ```bash
     git remote add origin [repository-url]
     ```
   - **Push Changes to a Remote Repository:**
     ```bash
     git push origin master
     ```
   - **Pull Changes from a Remote Repository:**
     ```bash
     git pull origin master
     ```

#### 8. **Forking and Collaborating**
   - **Fork a Repository:**
     - Use the GitHub interface to create a fork of a repository.
   - **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
     - On GitHub, after pushing changes to your fork, propose changes by creating a PR.

### Conclusion
- Understanding Git and its commands enhances collaboration and management in software development.
- Participants are encouraged to practice Git commands through personal projects.

### Next Steps
- Future sessions will include more complex Git operations, collaboration workflows, and best practices.

## Additional Commands and Features

### Configuring Remote Repositories
- **View Remote Repositories:**
  ```bash
  git remote -v
  ```
- **Remove a Remote Repository:**
  ```bash
  git remote remove [remote-name]
  ```

### Staging Area and Changes
- **Unstage a File:**
  ```bash
  git reset [filename]
  ```
- **Check Differences:**
  - Between working directory and index:
  ```bash
  git diff
  ```
  - Between staged and last commit:
  ```bash
  git diff --cached
  ```

### Reverting and Resetting Changes
- **Revert a Commit:**
  ```bash
  git revert [commit-id]
  ```
- **Reset to a Previous Commit (destructive operation):**
  ```bash
  git reset --hard [commit-id]
  ```

### Viewing Changes
- **Show Changes for a Specific File:**
  ```bash
  git log -- [filename]
  ```

### Working with Tags
- **Create a New Tag:**
  ```bash
  git tag [tag-name]
  ```
- **List All Tags:**
  ```bash
  git tag
  ```
- **Push a Tag to Remote Repository:**
  ```bash
  git push origin [tag-name]
  ```
